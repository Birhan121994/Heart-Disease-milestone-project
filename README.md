# Heart-Disease-milestone-project
These is the project that is built for the machine to predict whether the person has a heart disease or not. I have used a framework called scikitlearn
for training the machine learning model and I have used pandas and Numpy for data preprocessing and data cleaning. I also used matplotlib for data visualisation to
draw different graphs.
